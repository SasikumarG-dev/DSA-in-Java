DATA STRUCTURE:
 - Data structures are the programmetic way of storing and organizing data in efficient manner.

Data structures can be classified into two:
   
   i)  Linear Data Structure
      - Elements arranged in sequential manner.
      - Easy to traverse.
      - Array, Linked list, Stack, Queue are linear data structures.
      - Elements are arranged in single level.

   ii) Non-Linear Data Structure
      - Elements are not arranged in sequential manner.
      - Traversing takes time compared to linear data structure.
      - Tree, Graphs are Non-linear data structures.
      - Elements are arranged in Multi level.
